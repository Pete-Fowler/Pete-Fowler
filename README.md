I love building things, and the intellectual challenges and ongoing learning required in this field. I am currently building full stack web apps through the Flatiron School and The Odin Project curriculums. I've obtained strong problem-solving, communication, and collaboration skills through teaching myself web development, plus previous experience in music, journalism, private investigation, and healthcare. I am a dedicated rock climber and runner from Colorado.
